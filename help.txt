****   new approach no NER

you cannot run this alone
but you should build it use this
//if you dont have maven run it in the maven cmd in the intelij
mvn clean package -DskipTests
// -DskipTests this skep the tests phase due to build the jar becus the tests will not work as the kafka and mongo db doesnt work ( and if you run it the path is a docker path
not host path )
go to the batch-processing-pipeline and run the docker compose
that will run the docker  file here and bumvn clean package
ild the image
